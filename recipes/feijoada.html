    <h2>A classical brazilian pork and beans stew</h2>
    <p>A very traditional Brazilian stew made with black beans, sausage, and all the tasty bits of pork. 
        For a traditional Brazilian spread, serve hot with white rice and collard greens.
        You can look for the greens in Caribbean markets, but if unavailable try kale instead.</p>
